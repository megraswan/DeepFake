  <h1>What is a deepfake video?</h1>
    <p> Lately, there has been a phenomenon of newly developed technology on the internet that can manipulate visuals and audio, whether it is for creating false news around politicians or celebrities, or simply for social engineering purposes (Stover 2018). These forms of data manipulation and invalid representation of information are most commonly known as DeepFakes, which “merge, combine, and replace images and videos” using artificial intelligence (AI) with the goal of creating a convincing fraudulent video (Maras and Alexandrou 2019). The problem is, anyone with access to an adequately powerful graphics processing unit (GPU) is able to create convincing deepfake videos without much difficulty. </p>
<h1>Our Goal: </h1>
<p>
    DeepFake is a relatively new technology that is rapidly improving. DeepFakes have reached a point of technological development where without special analysis, it is effectively impossible to tell if the video was manipulated. Our primary objective with the development of this website is to create an easily accessible tool for detecting DeepFake videos at a high efficacy. By hosting our DeepFake detection tool on Chapman University’s powerful computing cluster, we are lowering the substantial technological barrier to DeepFake detection to allow anyone with access to the internet to effortlessly and efficiently confirm the veracity of various forms of media they may come across online.
</p>
    <h1>How do we detect Deepfakes?</h1>
<p> In order to check whether the videos are fake or not, we use Deepstar, an open-source software designed to detect fake videos effectively. Deepstar works by analyzing the mouth of the subject primarily, as the mouth is always edited in DeepFake videos (Deepstar Open Source Toolkit 2019). </p>
